# kind-of-libc
My first project as a 42 student named libft

I've built a library to use in my subsequent projects at 42SP. Most of functions here reproduce the behavior of libc funcitions. Some of the functions in LIBFT are: calloc, memcpm, putnbr_fd, split, strnchr, strdup, strlcat, strtrim, substr.

This project allows the 42 students to be familiar with some lower-level proceedings that are taken for granted in most higher-level languages. It makes possible for us dealing with things like string parsing, memory allocation and type conversion.

Since we are only authorized to use a few premade functions, it shapes our way to deal with C issues in step-by-step approach. This conditions us to think about solving problems from scratch without jumping straight to ready-made mechanisms that would be black boxes for us (since we wouldn't understand the full functioning of that)..
