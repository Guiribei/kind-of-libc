# kind-of-libc
My first project as a 42 student named libft

This project allows the 42 students to be familiar with some lower-level proceedings that are taken for granted in most higher-level languages. It makes possible for us dealing with things like string parsing, memory allocation and type conversion. Most functions here on LIBFT reproduce the behavior of libc functions.

Since we are only authorized to use a few premade functions, it shapes our way to deal with C issues in step-by-step approach. This conditions us to think about solving problems from scratch without jumping straight to ready-made mechanisms that would be black boxes for us (since we wouldn't understand the full functioning of that).
